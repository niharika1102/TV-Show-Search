# TV-Show-Search
A simple and easy-to-use web page for searching TV shows using an API.

The API used here is TV Maze. I am attaching the link for the same here: https://www.tvmaze.com/api.
The root URL of the API is: https://api.tvmaze.com
The endpoint is: /singlesearch/shows?q=:query

This tool returns the posters of shows which match the keywords searched by the user. You can visit the website from the link put up in the description of the repository.
